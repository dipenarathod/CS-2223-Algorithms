Q)“Double Trouble” is really a particular instantiation of the fundamental combinatorial game. What is the real name of the game, who “solved” it, and
when? Where does it show up in popular culture?
Ans:
"Nim" is the modern name.

Variants of Nim have been played since ancient times. The game is said to have originated in China—it closely resembles the Chinese game
of 捡石子 jiǎn-shízi, or "picking stones"—but the origin is uncertain; the earliest European references to Nim are from the beginning of the 16th century.

Its current name was coined by Charles L. Bouton of Harvard University, who also developed the complete theory of the game in 1901.

In Pop culture: In another game which is commonly known as Nim (but is better called the subtraction game), an upper bound is imposed on the number of objects
that can be removed in a turn. Instead of removing arbitrarily many objects, a player can only remove 1 or 2 or ... or k at a time.
This game is commonly played in practice with only one heap (for instance with k = 3 in the game Thai 21 on Survivor: Thailand, where it appeared
as an Immunity Challenge).
Other variations: The 21 game and The 100 game
