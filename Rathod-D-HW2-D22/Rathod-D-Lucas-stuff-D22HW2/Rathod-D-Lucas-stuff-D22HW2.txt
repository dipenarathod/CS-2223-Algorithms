Lucas' other findings:
Lucas devised methods for testing the primality of numbers. In 1857, at age 15, Lucas began testing the 
primality of 2^127 − 1 by hand, using Lucas sequences. In 1876, after 19 years of testing, he finally proved 
that 2^127 − 1 was prime; this would remain the largest known Mersenne prime for three-quarters of a century. 
This may stand forever as the largest prime number proven by hand. Later Derrick Henry Lehmer refined Lucas's 
primality tests and obtained the Lucas–Lehmer primality test.

He worked on the development of the umbral calculus.

The ratio of succesive Lucas numbers converge to the golden ratio.

The order of growth is exponential.

My own sequence, starting terms are 3 and 2. 
My sequence also converges to the golden ratio. Order of growth is exponential.
